# Alice bot
The idea of this project is to take the orginal AIML Project A.L.I.C.E and try and expand it.
This includes the orginal Program-ab code so the library does not need to be included.

I would like to understand how the code works, update it and bring in some near features.  
The API that it calls to find out things seems to now be dead/ or a business.  
There seems to be quite a bit of dead code and I would like to add a database engine to it to make it easy to improve.
